DOCUMENTATION FILE FOR VARIOUS TRANSCRIPTION TOOLS

All files should be of format .wav (to be safe)

!!IMPORTANT NOTE!! : To see the code to run each of the tools, look at #6.
1. SPHINX
- Completely free
- Unlimited
- Very easy to run
- The most inaccurate I have found so far


2. MICROSOFT BING VOICE RECOGNITION 
- Need to acquire a BING Key
- There is a quota of 5000 free transactions per month
- The software would only transcribe the first few words => Not a complete transcription of the entire audio file
- This is because the documentations says:
	"Your application must endpoint the audio to determine start and end of speech, which in turn is used by the service to determine the start and end of the request. 
	You may not upload more than 10 seconds of audio in any one request and the total request duration cannot exceed 14 seconds."
- If it exceeds 14 seconds, it gives this error: recognition request failed: Request timed out (> 14000 ms)
- However, this is probably the most accurate transcription I have come across
- Click on "Get started for free", and go from there. https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api


3. GOOGLE SPEECH TO TEXT API
- Need to send in request to do so
- Cannot comment because my request never got reviewed
- Here is the link to apply to get the API:
  https://cloud.google.com/speech/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2015-q2-cloud-na-solutions-bkws-freetrial-en&gclid=Cj0KEQjw4827BRDJvpbVuKvx-rIBEiQA2_CzsHZxSUSeKDdXflxMquJsakIldUS4sJ6mkNAHCbZ6CoQaAvbz8P8HAQ

4. IMB WATSON SPEECH TO TEXT
- I ended up using this
- Online demonstration: https://speech-to-text-demo.mybluemix.net/
- Requires credentials: which can be obtained easily. Instructions: https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/gs-credentials.shtml#getCreds
- Free quota of 1000 minutes per month
- Reasonably accurate


5. Others that are out there that I haven't used:
- https://api.ai/
- https://wit.ai/
- Dragon Naturally Speaking by Nuance ($$)
- ++

6. Recources that helped me:
- Shows use of various APIs in python code. Very, very useful: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/audio_transcribe.py
